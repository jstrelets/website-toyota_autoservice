My training project in the development of a simple website for an auto service. When creating, I used HTML, CSS, JSON, Webpack, Babel.
Implemented such elements as modal window, slider, timer, loading cards from the JSON server.

To start working with the project, you need to install all NPM packages. To do this, enter the following command in the console / task manager:
```
npm init
```
for successful loading of cards, enter:
```
npx json-server --watch toyota_db.json
```
